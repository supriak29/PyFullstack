# SELF JOIN

# Sometimes it is useful to join a table to itself. This is known as self join.
# We join a table to itself to evaluate the rows in the same table.

# To perform the self join we use either inner join or left join.
# Because the same table appears twice in a single query, we have to use the table aliases.
