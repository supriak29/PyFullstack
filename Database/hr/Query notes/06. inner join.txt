# To get the information of the department id 1,2,3 we use the below query -
select department_id, department_name
from departments
where department_id in (1,2,3);

# To get the information of the employee who works in the department id 1,2,3 we use below query -
select first_name, last_name, department_id
from employees
where department_id in (1,2,3)
order by department_id;

# To get the combined data from the employees & department names, we use INNER JOIN clause as below -
select first_name, last_name, employees.department_id, departments.department_name 
from employees inner join departments
on departments.department_id = employees.department_id
where employees.department_id in (1,2,3);
