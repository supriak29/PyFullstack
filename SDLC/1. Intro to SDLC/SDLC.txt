1) Plan - what all resources needed,the technologies to be used, risk involved, the deadline 
2) Analysis - through surveys/questionnaire we can get to know what all features are to be implemented into our website. Like if the customer wants to buy or rent a flat, Location prefered by the customer, Size of the flat(carpet area). 
3) Design - features which should be implemented, creating a blueprint/architecture of the website. Using third party libraries directly. 
4) Implementation - writing clean code on the basis of the analysis made and design created
5) Testing -  If requesting a call option is there, then is calling actually possible[unit test] and other tests to be conducted which thereby the developers will try to fix
6) Maintenance - One should be able to add the updates regarding the change in price of flats, etc. Keep on checking as per the feedback received. After 
certain time period is the site still working properly
